# FitMeIn

Staying healthy is a big deal, but let's be real – keeping up with it can be a bit overwhelming, especially when it comes to breaking a sweat. That's where FitMeIn comes in! If you're struggling to get yourself moving, don't worry – you're not alone. FitMeIn is all about making exercise more fun and finding friends along the way.

Here's how it works: just pick an activity you actually enjoy, and we'll hook you up with a workout buddy in your area who's into the same stuff. It's like having a fitness pal to cheer you on (and hold you to your word)! We're all about bringing people together, not just to get fit but to make some connections along the way. Let's crush those fitness goals and make some memories, shall we?

**Team** <br><br>
This was a group project in week 9 of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. We had 7 days to complete the project, tasked with architecting, designing, and collaboratively constructing a full-stack web app using Python and Django.
Working as a team to build this app taught us how to pair and mob program and practice the pull/push workflow within a group.<br><br>
Meet the Team: [Angelica Sandrini](https://github.com/AngelicaSandrini) | [Hannah Curran](https://github.com/HannahCurran) | [James Carter](https://github.com/JamesCarter10) | [Lucas Neno](https://github.com/LucasNeno)

So here it is, our [FitMeIn app](https://fitmein-d13b6d574438.herokuapp.com/)!

- Have full-CRUD data operations across any combination of the app's models (excluding the User model).
- Authenticate users using Django's built-in authentication.
